These are the main specifications for the Baiust University Management System using C# and MVC architecture. Additional features and requirements may be added based on the specific needs of the university. It is important to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders and users to ensure that the system meets their needs and expectations.
Architecture
BAIUST university management system using C# programming language.
I use MVC architecture because this architecture is One possible architecture that could be used to develop a university management system using C# is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. MVC is a well-established architecture used for developing web applications and is widely used with C# and the .NET framework.
MVC architecture consists of three components:
Model: The model component represents the data and business logic of the application. It communicates with the database to store and retrieve data and contains the business logic for processing and manipulating data.
View: The view component represents the user interface of the application. It presents data to the user and receives input from the user.
Controller: The controller component manages the flow of data between the view and the model components. It receives input from the user and communicates with the model to process data and generate output for the view.

Pros of MVC architecture:

Separation of concerns: MVC separates the concerns of data, business logic, and user interface, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
Reusability: The modular structure of MVC allows for reuse of components, reducing development time and effort.
Testability: MVC architecture promotes testability by allowing for easy unit testing of each component separately.
Cons of MVC architecture:
Cons of MVC architecture:
Model: The model represents the data and the business logic of an application. It is responsible for storing, manipulating and retrieving data.
View: The view represents the user interface and is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It communicates with the model to retrieve the data that needs to be displayed.
Controller: The controller acts as a mediator between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it and updates the model accordingly. It also updates the view with the updated data from the model.
Complexity: MVC architecture can be complex to implement, especially for large projects.
Learning curve: Developers new to MVC may need to spend time learning the architecture and how it works.
In summary, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture could be a suitable choice for developing a university management system using C#. Its separation of concerns, reusability, and testability benefits make it a popular choice for developing web applications. However, the complexity and learning curve associated with MVC may be a challenge for some developers. Ultimately, the choice of architecture will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
Verification Activities:
Code Reviews: Code reviews should be conducted to ensure that the code written by developers adheres to coding standards and best practices.
Unit Testing: Developers should write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components of the system.
Integration Testing: Integration testing should be performed to ensure that the various components of the system work together as expected.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): UAT should be performed by end-users to verify that the system meets their requirements and expectations.
Static Code Analysis: Static code analysis should be performed using tools like SonarQube to identify coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Code Coverage Analysis: Code coverage analysis should be performed to ensure that the unit tests cover a sufficient percentage of the code.
Validation Activities:
Functional Testing: Functional testing should be performed to verify that the system meets the functional requirements specified in the requirements document.
Performance Testing: Performance testing should be performed to ensure that the system can handle the expected load and respond within acceptable time frames.
Security Testing: Security testing should be performed to ensure that the system is secure and that user data is protected from unauthorized access or breaches.
Accessibility Testing: Accessibility testing should be performed to ensure that the system is accessible to users with disabilities.
Usability Testing: Usability testing should be performed to ensure that the system is easy to use and navigate, and that users can accomplish their tasks efficiently.
Compliance Testing: Compliance testing should be performed to ensure that the system complies with relevant regulations and standards.
Performing these V&V activities will help ensure that the University Management System meets the requirements of its users, functions as intended, and provides a reliable, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing various aspects of university operations.
